    We still have to run across many streets.
    Instead of traffic lights, there are warning signs:
  warningInscription: Watch out for snipers!

  text: >-
    This winter almost all trees in the city were cut down for heating. 
    Only a few are left.
    I saw one of those (a tiny birch) near the University.
    It had a sign with inscription on it:
  treeInscription: If you cut down this tree, it will be your last one!

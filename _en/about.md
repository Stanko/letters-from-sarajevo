# About the book

In the nineties, during the Bosnian war, our father was stuck in Sarajevo, while my mother, my brother Kosta and I managed to flee to Serbia. In spite of everything, our father was writing letters to us - funny, positive and full of drawings.

About ten years later, the book was published. It consists of my father's selected letters and replies Kosta was writing down in a notebook.

Combined, these letters tell a little bit of a different, more cheerful story about the war.

## About the website

The website was created as we wanted to share this story with everyone.

It is very hard to transfer the book of this form to a website. The difference between English and Serbian languages didn't help either. I've done the best I could, but I still recommend you experience *the Letters* on larger screens, instead of a mobile phone.

All of the content and website's code are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Stanko/letters-from-sarajevo) under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) liense.

## Drawings

Unfortunately, original letters were lost in the process, and we are left with only digital versions, scanned in a low resolution. That is why we own a huge thank you to my friend, [Ivan Nedeljković](https://www.instagram.com/sun_day_sign/), who redrew and digitalized all of the drawings based on original scans.

The result is marvelous, and below you can see one comparison of the original drawing and Ivan's version.

For now, if you want to help with translating the book to another language or if you have a suggestion, please do it by opening a new *Issue* <a href="https://github.com/Stanko/letters-from-sarajevo/issues">here</a> on GitHub.

Thank you for your interest!

Dear daddy,

I'm sorry about our room, but mom says that is not what is important. She says: "The room doesn't matter as long as we all get together again".

Here in Divljana I made a good friend, Mihajlo. (Samir is still my best friend, although I haven't seen him since we left Sarajevo.) Mihajlo lives on the ground floor of our resort, "Sutjeska". A few days ago they found a snake in his room. I think the snake won't climb to our room on the second floor.

As soon as I got to "Sutjeska", Mihajlo explained to me that we were in war with boys from the other resort, called "Igman". We immediately attacked some of them with pine cones. Since they'd outnumbered us, so we retreated and watched them from a far through Mihajlo's large binoculars. He said that he was going to move away soon, and that he was going to leave me the binoculars.

I'm proud to belong to "Sutjeska", although there are more boys in "Igman". Excluding Mihajlo and myself, there are only two younger boys in "Sutjeska" and they are not of much use, while the older ones don't participate in the war. Mihajlo and myself are leaders of "Sutjeska", while Sini≈°a is leading the "Igman" boys and he is a fourth-grader like us.

Stane made a good friend too, Ivica. As they don't go to school yet, they play all day long. The only person they don't like is fat Bora from the restaurant. He forces children to dip hands in some smelly liquid. Your hands get all chapped from it. Bora shouts at Stane and Ivica when they try to avoid that smelly water. Stane can't wait for you to come and show fat Bora who is the boss. I can't wait for you to come, too.

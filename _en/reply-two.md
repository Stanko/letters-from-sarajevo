Dear daddy,

I'm sorry for our room, but mom says that is not what is important. She says: "Room doesn't matter as long as we all get together again".

Here in Divljana I made a good friend, Mihajlo. (Samir is still my best friend, although I haven't seen him since we left Sarajevo.) Mihajlo lives on the ground floor of our resort, "Sutjeska". Few days ago snake was found in his room. I think snake won't climb to our room on the second floor.

As soon as I got to "Sutjeska", Mihajlo explained me that we are in a war with boys from the other resort, called "Igman". We immediately attacked some of them with pine cones. There were a lot of them, so we retreated and watched them from a far through Mihajlo's large binoculars. He told he is going to move away soon, and that he is going to leave me the binoculars.

I'm proud that I belong to "Sutjeska", even though boys from "Igman" are more numerous. Excluding Mihajlo and myself, there are only two younger boys in "Sutjeska" and they are not much of a use, while older ones don't participate in the war. Mihajlo and myself are leaders of "Sutjeska", while Sini≈°a is leading "Igman" boys and he is fourth grader like us.

Stane made a good friend too, Ivica. As they are not going to school yet, they are playing all day long. They only don't like fat Bora from the restaurant. He forces children to dip hands in some smelly liquid. Your hands get all rough from it. Bora shouts at Stane and Ivica when try to avoid that smelly water. Stane can't wait for you to come and show fat Bora who is the boss. I can't wait for you to come too.

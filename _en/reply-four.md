Dear daddy,

I was happy about your letter, when mom came in to the room crying. She found out uncle Grujo died. I went with her to the authorities, for her to ask a paper which allows her to travel by train for free. It took a couple of hours, and they barely gave it to her. She traveled this morning for the funeral, and told me to watch Stane. He is ooutside playing with Ivica. I'm watching them playing through the window. I haven't told Stane where mom left. I just told him she will be back tomorrow.

Two months ago we moved to "Igman", and now I'm hanging out with Siniša. In the beginning I was sad I left "Sutjeska", but now I'm proud to he part of "Igman". Boys from "Sutjeska" are attacking us cowardly with pine cones, and avoid real, open fight. I still haven't got a single letter from Mihajlo. Maybe he doesn't write to me because I became of the *Igman*-boys, or maybe he just forgot about me. (I don't know why, but I think Samir did not forgot me. He would write to me if he could.)

In "Igman", we five graders go to classes and professor comes from Niš every day. To get to the school, I just need to go down the stairs, and on the recess I can come back to the room and have a snack. After school Siniša and I leave the books and go outside immediately. Often Jelena and Aleksandra join us. Two of them are our best friends. Jelena is from "Sutjeska", but I convinced Siniša it doesn't matter, as girls don't participate in the war. To be honest, I like Jelena. I think I'm in love with her.

I showed your letters to Jelena. She said she would love to learn to draw as nice as you. She read my letter to you too. She promised she won't tell anyone. I hope you will read them soon.

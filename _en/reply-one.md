Dear daddy,

We got your letter! Mom told me that I can't send you a reply, as nothing gets delivered to Sarajevo. That's why I'm writing to you in a notebook, and you will read them all of this when you come to us.

It's been six months since we left Sarajevo in the windowless bus. As the bus was leaving I watched you wave until I lost sight of you in the distance. "It's good there are no windows", I thought to myself, "or else I would be sick otherwise". We passed soldiers who'd occasionally shout something at us. All of them wore different colored uniforms.

And then the bus broke down, right next to a group of soldiers. They ordered everyone to come off the bus and started searching the baggage. One of them, with a cowboy hat and a mustache was speaking in English with other soldier in blue berets. He noticed I was watching him, patted me on the head and told me: "Don't worry, everything will be alright."

We waited all together for the next bus. When it finally came, it was already crowded and its windows were in place. I knew it I would get sick in this one.

Mom fought her way through the crowd and managed to get us on the bus. She told us she would join us as soon as she got our backpacks. I stood with Stane in the overcrowded bus and tried to see the door. When the bus started moving, I started to cry, while squeezing Stane's shoulders. Next thing I remember are the people around me, caressing me and saying: "Don't worry, look, your mummy is here."

I threw up in that bus.

I remember you said you would join us soon and that we should enjoy Belgrade in the meantime.  But we are not in Belgrade. We are in a small countryside village called Divljana, in a resort called "Sutjeska". I hope you will be here soon.

Lots of love from mom, Stane and me.

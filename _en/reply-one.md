Dear daddy,

We got your letter! Mom told me that I can't send you a reply, as nothing gets delivered to Sarajevo. That's why I'm writing to you in a notebook, and you can read them all together when you come to us.

It's been six months since we left Sarajevo in the bus with no windows. As bus was leaving I was watching you wave until I lost the sight of you in the distance. "It is good windows are broken", I thought to myself, "I would be sick otherwise". We were passing by groups of soldiers, and some of them were shouting at us. Every group had their uniforms in a different color.

And then the bus broke down, right next to a group of soldiers. They ordered everyone to come off the bus and started searching the baggage. One of them, with a cowboy hat and mustaches was speaking in English with other soldier in blue berets. He noticed I was watching him, petted me on the head and told me: "Don't worry, everything will be alright."

We waited for another bus. When it finally came, it was already crowded and it's windows were in place. I knew it I would get sick in this one.

Mom fought her way through the crowd and managed to get us in the bus. She told us she would join us as soon as she gets get our backpacks. I stood with Stane in the overcrowded bus and tried to see the door. When the bus started moving, I started to cry, while squeezing Stane by his shoulders. Next thing I remember are the people around me, they were caressing me and saying: "Don't worry, look, your mummy is here."

I vomited in that bus.

I remember you said you would join us soon and that we should enjoy Belgrade meanwhile.  But we are not in Belgrade. We are in a small countryside village called Divljana, in a resort called "Sutjeska". I hope you will be here soon.

Lots of love from mom, Stane and me.

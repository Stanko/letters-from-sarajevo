Dear dad,

Your letter arrived while mom and I were in the hospital. (Meanwhile granny Ruža from our room was watching Stane.)

We ended in the hospital by eating poisonous mushrooms. Often, Auntie Nada from the first floor would take me to the forrest to pick mushrooms. It was interesting, she was talking about nature all the time. In the evening we would bring mushrooms back, and everyone from the room would eat dinner together. After one of those dinners I went outside with Mihajlo. We were watching moon through binoculars, as it was a telescope. Suddenly, I felt weak. I came back to the room and told mom. Everyone turned around to me: "You too?".

The ambulance took us to Niš. For the first time ever, mom was happy Stane is a picky eater. He didn't even try mushrooms.

We've spent around ten days in the hospital, children and parents separated. The next day we were feeling better but we were still getting infusions. Yesterday, we all returned to Divljana, again by ambulance. Auntie Nada and I made a deal not to pick mushrooms again.

Today I found Mihajlo moved away to Novi Sad. Because I was in the hospital, he left binoculars to the other boy. He left a message with him as well, that he is going to write to me from Novi Sad. Now, I'm going to receive letters both from him and you. (I wish you were both here.)

      `Dear Daddy,`,
      `It's been six months since we left. I still remember that bus with the broken windows, and you waving goodbye in the distance. I remember thinking that I wouldn't be sick on that bus, because of the fresh air coming through the broken windows.`,
      `We were passing by groups of soldiers, and some of them were shouting at us. And every time their uniforms were different.`,
      `And then the bus broke down, amid a group of soldiers. They ordered everyone to come off the bus and started to search the baggage. One of them, with a cowboy hat on his head, looked at me and said: "Don't worry, everything will be alright."`,
      `We waited for another bus. When it finally came, I saw it was already crowded. Its windows weren't broken and I knew I would be sick inside. `,
      `Everybody was trying to get on the bus. Holding Stane and me, mama fought her way into the bus. She told us she would join us soon. She had to go out again to get our baggage. We stood in the overcrowded bus and tried to see the door. When the bus started moving, I started to cry, while holding Stane by his shoulders. Then I remember the people around me, they were caressing me and saying: "Don't worry, look, your mummy is here."`,
      `I was sick.`,
      `I remember you said you would join us in Belgrade very soon. But we are not in Belgrade. We are in a small countryside village called Divljana. There are twelve people sleeping in every room, but the nature is beautiful. I hope you will be here soon.`,
      `Lots of love from mama, Stane and me.`,
      `Kosta`,

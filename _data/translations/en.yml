  The beginning of the Bosnian war.
  Ten year old Kosta flees Sarajevo, together with his mother and his younger brother.
  His father stays in the besieged and bombarded city and survives the tough times with the other Sarajevans.
  In spite of everything, he writes funny letters to his sons, trying to encourage and cheer them up.
  Ten years later, using authentic letters written by his father, Kosta writes the story of his childhood.

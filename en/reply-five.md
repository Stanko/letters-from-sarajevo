Dear dad,

Stane and I love your stove. Here's how you can make hot chocolate on it. Put three spoonfuls of cocoa, three spoonfuls of dry milk, and some sugar in a pot. Then add some water and stir it all up and heat it on your stove. (I got the recipe from nana Ruža from the Sutjeska.)

We threw a party for New Year's, in the room that we use as a classroom in the mornings. We played music on a cassette player, and then we danced to it. I wanted to confess my love to Jelena, but I lost all courage when she showed up in a dress. She seemed different somehow, as though she wasn't the same girl I spend so much time with. I guess Siniša figured out what's going on. He teased me and tried to convince me to dance with Jelena but to no avail. I stood bewilderedly in the corner of the classroom, watching her dance with a seventh-grader from the Sutjeska. And to think there was a time when I fought for that stupid Sutjeska, I ranted to myself.

Stane and Ivica had a much better time. They danced with all the younger girls, even with a couple of two-graders.

I didn't say anything to Jelena, and now we spend time as we did before. I don't know if I'll ever muster the courage and tell her how I feel. Having you here would make things easier for me.

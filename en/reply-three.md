Dear dad,

Your letter arrived while mum and I were in the hospital. (While we were gone, nana Ruža from our room took care of Stane.)

We were taken to the hospital because of poisonous mushrooms. Mrs Nada from the first floor often took me mushroom picking in the woods. It was fun; she would speak about nature the whole time. In the evening, we would return to the Inn with mushrooms, and everybody from the room would have dinner together. After one of those dinners, I went outside with Mihajlo. We were watching the Moon through his binoculars like through a telescope. Suddenly, I felt a little queasy. I went back to the room and told mum that I was feeling sick. Then everybody turned toward me and said "You too?"

The ambulance took us to Niš. For the first time ever, mum was happy about Stane being a picky eater. He wouldn't even try the mushrooms.

We stayed in the hospital for some ten days, kids apart from the grownups. We felt better the next day already, but we were still on an IV. We all returned to Divljana yesterday, riding the ambulance once again. Mrs Nada and I agreed we wouldn't go looking for mushrooms again.

Today I found out that Mihajlo had moved to Novi Sad. Since I was in the hospital, he gave the binoculars to another boy. He told me Mihajlo had said he would write to me from Novi Sad. Now I'll receive letters from him and you. (I'd rather you were both here.)

    Almost all of the trees in the city were cut down for firewood last winter.
    There's only a few left.
    I saw one of them (a small birch tree) near the faculty of veterinary medicine.
    There was a sign on it:
  treeInscription: If you cut this birch down, it will be the last one you'll ever cut.
  alt: The last tree left standing in the park, a small birch with a sign "If you cut this tree down, it will be the last one you'll ever cut!"
